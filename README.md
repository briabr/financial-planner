# Financial Planning

![Financial Planner](Images/financial-planner.png)

## Description

We use APIs as part of the technical solution - to create two financial analysis tools.

The first will be a personal finance planner that will allow users to visualize their savings composed by investments in shares and cryptocurrencies to assess if they have enough money as an emergency fund.

The second tool will be a retirement planning tool that will use the Alpaca API to fetch historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio composed of stocks and bonds, then run Monte Carlo simulations to project the portfolio performance at 30 years.Then we use the Monte Carlo data to calculate the expected portfolio returns given a specific initial investment amount.
